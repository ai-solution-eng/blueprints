# NVIDIA AI Blueprint: Vulnerability Analysis for Container Security
This Helm chart has been built upon the [NVIDIA Vulnerability Analysis for Container Security Blueprint](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/vulnerability-analysis) and deploys it, along with additional services on HPE Private Cloud AI (PCAI) environments.

It is reusing code developed internally at HPE, and available in the [blueprint-vulnerability-analysis internal repo](https://github.hpe.com/hpe/blueprint-vulnerability-analysis/tree/develop). 
This internal repo details its improvements over the original NVIDIA Blueprint, mainly the addition of an Ezwrapper application that introduces a simplified, configurable input JSON format and that manages all communication with the vulnerability analysis backend.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware requirements

This blueprint requires **one NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support** to run, even when not self-hosting the NIMs used by this blueprint (Meta Llama 3.1 70B Instruct as LLM and NV-EmbedQA-E5-v5 as embedding model by default).


### Prepare Required API Keys
   These APIs are required by the workflow to retrieve vulnerability information from databases, perform online searches, and execute LLM queries.

  - **GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) Database**
    - Follow [these](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) instructions to create a personal access token. No repository access or permissions are required for this API.
    - This will be `GHSA_API_KEY` in the values file.
  - **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**
    - Follow [these](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) instructions to create an API key.
    - This will be `NVD_API_KEY` in the values file.
  - **SerpApi**
    - Go to https://serpapi.com/ and create a SerpApi account. Once signed in, navigate to Your Account > Api Key.
    - This will be `SERPAPI_API_KEY` in the values file.
  - **NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM)**
    - There are two possible methods to generate an API key for NIM:
      - Sign in to the [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover?signin=true) portal with your email.
        - Click on any [model](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama-3_1-70b-instruct), then click "Get API Key", and finally click "Generate Key".
      - Sign in to the [NVIDIA NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/) portal with your email.
        - Select your organization from the dropdown menu after logging in. You must select an organization which has NVIDIA AI Enterprise (NVAIE) enabled.
        - Click on your account in the top right, select "Setup" from the dropdown.
        - Click the "Generate Personal Key" option and then the "+ Generate Personal Key" button to create your API key.
    - This will be `NVIDIA_API_KEY` in the values file.

## Import Framework

1. Log in to the HPE AI Essentials web interface.

2. Click the **Tools & Frameworks** icon on the left navigation bar.

3. Click **+ Import Framework**.

- **Framework Name**: of your choice, for example `NVIDIA Vulnerability Analysis for Container Security`.
- **Description**: of your choice, for example `This blueprint demonstrates accelerated analysis on common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) at an enterprise scale, reducing mitigation from days and hours to just seconds.`.
- **Category**: of your choice, for example `Analytics`.
- **Framework Icon**: Click `Select File` and select the icon you want to use, e.g. the logo file in this repo.
- **Helm Chart**: Choose the packaged `.tgz` chart file available in this folder.
- **Namespace**: where you created your secrets in, for example `vulnerability-analysis`
- **Release**: of your choice, for example `vulnerability-analysis`

4. Use your API keys to fill the following values, under the secrets section (line 82):
- **NVD_API_KEY**: copy your NVD API key
- **GHSA_API_KEY**: copy your GHSA API key
- **NVIDIA_API_KEY**: copy your NVIDIA API key
- **SERPAPI_API_KEY**: copy your SerpApi key


## How to use

### Input Preprocessing/Formatting

1. Scan your image for CVEs (using [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/getting-started/) or another scanner).
2. Generate SBOM (using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) or another SBOM generation tool) and base64 encode the raw SBOM file.
3. Create your input JSON file and fills in all required fields. Refer to the following example for reference:

```
{
  "repos": [
    {
      "images": [
        {
          "name": "image1",
          "tag": "tag1",
          "sbom": "<raw-base64-encoded-sbom>",
          "cves": ["CVE-1", "CVE-2"]
        },
        {
          "name": "image2",
          "tag": "tag2",
          "sbom": "<raw-base64-encoded-sbom>",
          "cves": ["CVE-1", "CVE-2", "CVE-3"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An example of such JSON input is available under the [input_examples folder](input_examples), where the redis:8.2.2 image is analyzed in regards to two CVEs.

### Submit the analysis request

Note the application endpoint, displayed on its tile, after its deployment. It should be "https://morpheus-vulnerability-analysis.<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>".

To submit your analysis request, run this curl command:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @path/to/your/formatted_input.json -o output.json <APPLICATION_ENDPOINT>/analyze
```

After a **few minutes of processing (depending on the input)**, the result of the analysis should be available in the the JSON file specified after the -o flag.
