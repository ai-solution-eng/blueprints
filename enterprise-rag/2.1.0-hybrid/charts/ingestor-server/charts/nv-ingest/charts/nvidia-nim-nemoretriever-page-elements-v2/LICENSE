Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable and non-sublicensable (except as expressly provided in this Agreement) license to: (i) install and use copies of the Licensed Materials; (ii) modify and create Derivative Models of the Licensed Materials; and (iii) modify and create derivative works of software provided in source code format (“Derivatives”); provided that (i) through (iii) for the sole purpose of internal test and evaluation in systems with NVIDIA GPUs and without use in production (“Purpose”).
1.2 License Grant to NVIDIA. If you create Derivatives or Derivative Models, you grant NVIDIA a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, under your intellectual property rights, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import, create derivative works of and otherwise commercialize and exploit at NVIDIA’s discretion any modifications and Derivative Models created by or for you, excluding any Derivative Model weights or parameters. You may, but are not required, to deliver Derivative Models to NVIDIA.
1.3 Derivative Models. “Derivative Models” mean all derivative works, adaptations, extensions or enhancements to the Licensed Materials, works based on the Licensed Materials, or any other model that is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Licensed Materials to another model, to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Licensed Materials, including distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Licensed Materials for training the other model. If you create a Derivative Model or modify any files in the Licensed Materials, those modifications must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files such that modifications are not misrepresented as the original Licensed Materials. Except as necessary to give attribution to works as described in this section, you are not granted any trademark license under this Agreement.
2 License Restrictions. You may not:
2.1 Use the Licensed Materials for any purpose other than as described in Section 1 above.
2.2 Sell, rent, sublicense, transfer or distribute or make available to others (beyond Authorized Users) any portion of the Licensed Materials or Derivative Models.
2.3 Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the Licensed Materials.
2.4 Modify or create derivative works of the Licensed Materials, except as expressly granted in Section 1 above.
2.5 Use Licensed Materials to create or distribute to others any defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar, offensive or violent content.
2.6 Use an output or artifact of the Licensed Materials or Licensed Material Derivatives to improve or develop any other artificial intelligence model (excluding the Licensed Materials).
2.7 Change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the Licensed Materials.
2.8 Use the Licensed Materials in any manner that would cause them to become subject to an open source software license; subject to the terms in the “Components Under Other Licenses” section below.

You may allow your employees or employees of your subsidiary(ies), and for educational institutions including enrolled students, to access and use the Licensed Materials from your secure network to perform the work authorized by this Agreement on your behalf. You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. Any act or omission that if committed by you would constitute a breach of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement if committed by your authorized users.
4 Pre-Release. The Licensed Materials may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility and reliability standards relative to commercial offerings. You use the Licensed Materials at your own risk, understanding Licensed Materials are not intended for use, and should not be used, in production or business-critical systems.
